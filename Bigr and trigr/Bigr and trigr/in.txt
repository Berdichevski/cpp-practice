Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning requires labeled data for training, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns in data without explicit labels. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions through trial and error. The most common software libraries for machine learning are TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
