Love is a miracle, love is a force.Force within the heart, force within the soul.The soul ignites, the soul blazes.Blazing with passion, blazing with love.Love shines, love warms.Warming the souls, warming the bodies.Bodies lean, bodies unite.Uniting in a kiss, uniting in embrace.Embraces that are unforgettable, embraces that repeat again and again.Again and again, like eternity.Eternity of love, eternity of passion.Passion burns, passion ignites.Igniting in the heart, igniting in the blood.Blood pulsates, blood burns.Burning with desire, burning with love.Love is a miracle, love is a force.
